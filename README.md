# semester-project-1

This is my Semester Project 1 delievery in my Front End Developer studies. 

This website represents the site of a fictional science museum mainly for kids between the age of 7-15, and their parents and teachers.
The website is supposed to inspire young curious mind and invite them to visit the museum. 

This site is made with html and css, no javascript. 
Some of the "links" and buttons are meant to be "fake", just for the design of the page.
