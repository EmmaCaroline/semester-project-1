					<h2>Cosmology</h2>
					<div class="textContainer">
						<p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
						‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and 
						know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations 
						and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators 
						who used the stars to travel by.</p>
						<p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, 
						to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

					<h2>Evolution</h2>
					<div class="textContainer">
						<p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question 
						of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin 
						proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
						understanding our place in this world.</p>
						<p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today 
						have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
						creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, 
						and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

					<h2>Biology and medicine</h2>
					<div class="textContainer">
						<p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are 
						offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
						<p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality 
						of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
						Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at 
						some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
						<p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing 
						animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

					<h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
					<div class="textContainer">
						<p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science 
						of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. 
						You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

					<h2>Ecology</h2>
					<div class="textContainer">
						<p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important 
						it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
						<p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction 
						of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
